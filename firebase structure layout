Questions:
Firebase Integration:

Do you already have the Firestore setup for storing bookings? If so, could you share the structure (fields) you want to save for each booking (e.g., customer name, dates, room type, etc.)?
Handling Form Submission:

Once the user submits the form, should we store the booking details in Firestore immediately? Would you prefer to send a confirmation email after a successful booking submission?
Should the user see a confirmation message or redirect to a confirmation page?
Authentication:

Is there any authentication in place for users (e.g., Google login)? Should we associate bookings with the user account?
Real-time Updates:

Do you want to show available rooms in real-time? For instance, if one room is booked, it should update on the front end.
Booking Validation:

How would you like us to validate the form? For instance, should there be checks to make sure the check-out date is later than the check-in date?
Room Availability:

Should we check for the availability of the selected room before confirming the booking? If yes, do you have a structure for room availability?



Set Up Firestore Structure:
We'll create a Firestore collection for storing bookings. The fields you need based on the form inputs can be:

User Information: userId (for identifying the user who made the booking)
Booking Details:
checkInDate: Date
checkOutDate: Date
adults: Number
children: Number
rooms: String (Room type selected, e.g., "Deluxe")
status: String (can be "Pending", "Confirmed", etc.)
2. Form Submission & Validation:
After submitting the form, we’ll validate:

The check-out date should be after the check-in date.
Room availability should be checked before submitting the booking. We can query Firestore to see if the room is available for the selected dates.
3. Real-Time Updates:
We'll use Firestore real-time listeners to update room availability on the front end. When a booking is made, the room availability will be updated in real-time.

4. Submitting the Form:
When the user submits the form:

We'll check if the room is available.
If available, we’ll store the booking details in Firestore.
After the booking is stored, we’ll send a confirmation email (this can be done using Firebase functions later).
We'll update the front end with the new room availability in real-time.
Next Steps:
Set Up Firestore: We'll first create a Firestore structure and integrate it into your app.

Form Submission Logic: Then, we’ll add the form submission logic, validation, and room availability check.
